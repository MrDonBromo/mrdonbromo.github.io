Iâ€™m passionate about turning data into actionable insights. I enjoy working with Python, machine learning models, and data visualization tools like Power BI.



## Projects

### ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Prediction for a Telecommunications Company  
**Supervised Machine Learning â€“ XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression**

- Built a supervised machine learning solution to predict customer churn for a telecom company.
- Integrated and cleaned multiple data sources to create a unified, production-ready dataset.
- Applied feature engineering, class balancing techniques, and cross-validation to improve model robustness.
- Used `GridSearchCV` to tune hyperparameters for `XGBoost`, `RandomForestClassifier`, and `LogisticRegression`.
- Evaluated models using **F1-score** and **ROC-AUC curves** to select the most performant approach.
